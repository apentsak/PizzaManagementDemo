TO INSTALL

Just rename `.env.example` in be-src to `.env`
Then `docker-compose up --build`

FE-server runs on `localhost:9000`

NOTES

Docker build doesn't run correctly on windows.
VueJS just doesn't build on windows. Couldn't resolve the issue.
Works perfectly on linux systems though.

Installation: rename .
